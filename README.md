Before running code instal external Libraries in Project Structure, they are located in Folder "External Libraries">>"Jars"
Then add in libraries add Library in folder "External Libraries">>"lwjgl">> linux/ macOS/ Windows. Depends on operating system
Then run Game class.
Use "WASD" keys to control and "p" to pause a game
You can also use "ESC" button to close it.
So good luck
